# Mission-to-Mars
## Overview/Purpose:
   * The purpose of this assignment was to adjust Robin's current web app to include all four of the hemisphere images. To do this, BeautifulSoup and Splinter were used to scrape full-resolution images of Marsâ€™s hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images. Below are the deliverables.
   
     * **Deliverable 1:** Scrape Full-Resolution Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
     * **Deliverable 2:** Update the Web App with Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
     * **Deliverable 3:** Add Bootstrap 3 Components
